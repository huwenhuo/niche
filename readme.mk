Single-Cell RNA and ATAC-Seq Analysis for MLL-AF9 Leukemic Model
================================================================

This repository contains code for single-cell RNA and ATAC-Seq analysis of the MLL-AF9 leukemic model across different time points. The analysis is performed using **Scanpy** and **Seurat/Signac**.

Key Features:
-------------

*   **Data Import & Preprocessing**: Loading datasets and filtering low-quality cells
*   **Doublet Removal**: Identifying and removing doublets
*   **Cell Type Annotation**: Assigning cell identities
*   **Cell Population Analysis**: Investigating MSC and bone marrow cell populations
*   **Chromosomal Status Changes**: Analyzing genomic alterations
*   **Cell-Cell Interaction Analysis**: Studying intercellular communication

This repository provides a comprehensive workflow for exploring leukemic progression at the single-cell level.
